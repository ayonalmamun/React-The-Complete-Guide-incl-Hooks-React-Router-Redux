useEffect hook calls with two arguments with two parameters

first argument is a function that should be executed after every component evalutation
if the specified dependencies changed

and the specified dependencies are the second argument that you pass in

thats an array full of dependencies
and whenever such a dependencies changes that the first function will re run 

therefore in the first function you can put any side effect code and that code will only execute 
when the dependencies specified by you changed and not when the component re renders
